The speakers discuss how children are always asking why and how adults often have to admit that they don\\'t know the answer. \\n\\nTopic 2: The External Brain Pack of Civilization\\n\\nSummary: The conversation shifts to the idea of having a \"one page cheat\" or a brief summary of a complex subject. The speakers discuss how people often rely on external sources of knowledge and how they have memorized certain things but don\\'t really understand them. \\n\\nTopic 3: Reading Habits\\n\\nSummary: The conversation turns to the speakers\\' reading habits and how they have changed over time. They discuss how reading a large number of books is often a vanity metric and how they prefer to read the best hundred books over and over again until they absorb them. They also talk about how they read to satisfy their genuine intellectual curiosity and how it can be anything from nonsense to science fiction.',\n",

They discuss how people tend to cultivate and curate an unrealistic version of their life, and how compliments and insults can easily build up or tear down a person's self-image. They also discuss the drawbacks of being famous, and how it can be difficult to understand unless you experience it.\\n\\nTopic 3: Interruptions from Fame:\\nThe conversation concludes with a discussion of how fame can lead to interruptions in life, such as people coming up to take pictures without caring about the situation. The speaker's wife shares her experience of how she used to think this was just part of the price of being famous, but now that it interrupts her life and the lives of her children, she has a different perspective.\\n\\nSubtitles\"],\n",
